                      his ground and fought other versions of the tale say that achilles chased after hector two times and one time he was
                      delivered by the gods however on their second encounter achilles trapped hector and challenged him after a legendary fight achilles kills hector
                      influenced by his anger he drags the body of hector behind his chariot round the walls of troy three times and refuses
                      to allow it to receive funeral rites much to the dismay of achilles the body of hector miraculously heals and will not

                      and kisses the hands of the man who killed his son the greatness of achilles lies in not just being the greatest
                      greek fighter ever but in knowing the choice provided to him by destiny his mother thetis had prophesied to him that if
                      he pulled out of the trojan war he would enjoy a long and a happy life if achilles fought however he would
                      die before the walls of troy but assure an everlasting glory surpassing that of all other heroes he had made the choice

                      in homer in homer s odyssey there is a passage in which odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades
                      one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a
                      slave than be dead this has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life but also as indignity to his martyrdom
                      being slighted the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son alexander the great son of the epiran
                      princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said

                      plato and aeschines and seems to have inspired the enigmatic verses in lycophron s third century alexandra that claim achilles slayed troilus
