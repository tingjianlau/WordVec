      conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in communication skills social interactions and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior few
      clinicians today solely use the dsm iv criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism which are based on the absence or delay
      of certain developmental milestones many clinicians instead use an alternate means or a combination thereof to more accurately determine a diagnosis terminology
      when referring to someone diagnosed with autism the term autistic is often used however the term person with autism can be used
      instead this is referred to as person first terminology the autistic community generally prefers the term autistic for reasons that are fairly
      controversial this article uses the term autistic see talk page characteristics dr leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one
      nine four three there is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic and physicians will often
      arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis much of this is due to the sensory system of an autistic which is
      quite different from the sensory system of other people since certain stimulations can affect an autistic differently than a non autistic and
      the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another nevertheless professionals within pediatric care
      and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible however some people do
      not believe in treatment for autism either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can
      do more harm than good social development typically developing infants are social beings early in life they do such things as gaze
        at people turn toward voices grasp a finger and even smile in contrast most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem
        to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give and take of everyday human interaction even in the first few months
        of life many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as
        non autistic children children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such
        things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating or resist attention altogether later they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents
        displays of anger or affection in a typical way research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their parents their
        expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling teaching and playing
        with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected attachment behavior children with autism appear to lack theory of mind
        the ability to see things from another person s perspective a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of
        five and possibly other higher primates such as adult gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos typical five year olds can develop insights into other
        people s different knowledge feelings and intentions interpretations based upon social cues e g gestures facial expressions an individual with autism seems
        to lack these interpretation skills an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people s actions the social alienation
        of autistic and asperger s people is so intense from childhood that many of them have imaginary friends as companionship however having
        an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non autistic children although not universal it is
        common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior this can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem
        out of proportion to the situation individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments they may react negatively to changes in
        them it is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression increased levels of self stimulatory behavior self injury or extensive withdrawal
        in overwhelming situations sensory system a key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much
        like those found in sensory integration dysfunction children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input indicators of this disorder include
        oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch movement sights or sounds physical clumsiness or carelessness poor body awareness a tendency to be easily distracted
        impulsive physical or verbal behavior an activity level that is unusually high or low not unwinding or calming oneself difficulty learning new
        movements difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another social and or emotional problems delays in speech language or motor skills
        specific learning difficulties delays in academic achievement one common example is an individual with autism hearing a person with autism may have
        trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual or the person with autism may be unable to filter out
        sounds in certain situations such as in a large crowd of people see cocktail party effect however this is perhaps the part
        of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person so these examples may not apply to every autistic
        it should be noted that sensory difficulties although reportedly common in autistics are not part of the dsm iv diagnostic criteria for
        autistic disorder communication difficulties by age three typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones one of the earliest is babbling by
        the first birthday a typical toddler says words turns when he or she hears his or her name points when he or
        she wants a toy and when offered something distasteful makes it clear that the answer is no speech development in people with
        autism takes different paths some remain mute throughout their lives while being fully literate and able to communicate in other ways images
        sign language and typing are far more natural to them some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during
        the first few months of life but stop soon afterwards others may be delayed developing language as late as the teenage years
        still inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware once given appropriate accommodations many will happily
        converse for hours and can often be found in online chat rooms discussion boards or websites and even using communication devices at
        autism community social events such as autreat those who do speak often use language in unusual ways retaining features of earlier stages
        of language development for long periods or throughout their lives some speak only single words while others repeat the same phrase over
        and over some repeat what they hear a condition called echolalia sing song repetitions in particular are a calming joyous activity that
        many autistic adults engage in many people with autism have a strong tonal sense and can often understand spoken language some children
        may exhibit only slight delays in language or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies but have great difficulty
        in sustaining typical conversations the give and take of non autistic conversation is hard for them although they often carry on a
        monologue on a favorite subject giving no one else an opportunity to comment when given the chance to converse with other autistics
        they comfortably do so in parallel monologue taking turns expressing views and information just as neurotypicals people without autism have trouble understanding
        autistic body languages vocal tones or phraseology people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism in particular
        autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say
        or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words the body language of people with autism
        can be difficult for other people to understand facial expressions movements and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with
        autism but do not match those used by other people also their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in
        reflecting their feelings and the auditory system of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations what seems to non autistic
        people like a high pitched sing song or flat robot like voice is common in autistic children some autistic children with relatively
        good language skills speak like little adults rather than communicating at their current age level which is one of the things that
        can lead to problems since non autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic body language and since autistic natural language may
        not tend towards speech autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need as anybody might do in such
        a situation they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want while waiting for non autistic people to learn
        to communicate with them people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them communication difficulties may contribute to autistic
        people becoming socially anxious or depressed repetitive behaviors although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control unusual
        repetitive motions known as self stimulation or stimming may set them apart these behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more
        subtle some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes others suddenly freeze
        in position as children they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way not using them for
        pretend play if someone accidentally moves one of these toys the child may be tremendously upset autistic children often need and demand
        absolute consistency in their environment a slight change in any routine in mealtimes dressing taking a bath or going to school at
        a certain time and by the same route can be extremely disturbing people with autism sometimes have a persistent intense preoccupation for
        example the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners train schedules or lighthouses often they show great interest in
        different languages numbers symbols or science topics repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well perseveration of a single
        word or phrase even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child s daily routine effects
        in education children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day these unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal
        student because they have trouble understanding people s thoughts and feelings they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them
        they do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying this
        inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful teachers need to be aware of a student s disorder so
        that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught some students learn better with
        visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way because of this many teachers create visual schedules for
        their autistic students this allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day so they know what to prepare
        for and what activity they will be doing next some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next so
          this visual schedule can help to reduce stress research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children autistic
          students have problems in schools not only with language and communication but with socialization as well they feel self conscious about themselves
          and many feel that they will always be outcasts by allowing them to work with peers they can make friends which in
          turn can help them cope with the problems that arise by doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment
          of the classroom a teacher s aide can also be useful to the student the aide is able to give more elaborate
          directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child the aide can also facilitate the autistic child
          in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class this allows
          a partially one on one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be
          given the extra help that they need there are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students a teacher
          needs to become familiar with the child s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child every child is
          going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them students with autism spectrum disorders
          typically have high levels of anxiety and stress particularly in social environments like school if a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior
          it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety preparing students for new situations by writing social
          stories can lower anxiety teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as the incredible five point scale or other
          cognitive behavioral strategies can increase a student s ability to control excessive behavioral reactions dsm definition autism is defined in section two
          nine nine zero zero of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv as a total of six or more
          items from one two and three with at least two from one and one each from two and three qualitative impairment in

          one of the following delay in or total lack of the development of spoken language not accompanied by an attempt to compensate
          through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime in individuals with adequate speech marked impairment in the ability to initiate

          of the following areas with onset prior to age three years one social interaction two language as used in social communication or
          three symbolic or imaginative play the disturbance is not better accounted for by rett s disorder or childhood disintegrative disorder the diagnostic
          and statistical manual s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective see the dsm cautionary statement the criteria
          for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely instead solely relying on other methods for determining
            the diagnosis types of autism autism presents in a wide degree from those who are nearly dysfunctional and apparently mentally handicapped to
            those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional normal to the general public in terms of both classification and
            therapy autistic individuals are often divided into those with an iq eight zero are referred to as having high functioning autism hfa
            low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living rather than to
            iq the terms low and high functioning are controversial and not all autistics accept these labels further these two labels are not
            currently used or accepted in autism literature this discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate iq with functioning and
            may refuse to serve high iq autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks or may
            fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered lfa for example some professionals refuse to recognize autistics
            who can speak or write as being autistic at all because they still think of autism as a communication disorder so severe
            that no speech or writing is possible as a consequence many high functioning autistic persons and autistic people with a relatively high
            iq are underdiagnosed thus making the claim that autism implies retardation self fulfilling the number of people diagnosed with lfa is not
            rising quite as sharply as hfa indicating that at least part of the explanation for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics
            asperger s and kanner s syndrome asperger described his patients as little professors in the current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
            disorders dsm iv tr the most significant difference between autistic disorder kanner s and asperger s syndrome is that a diagnosis of
            the former includes the observation of delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas with onset prior to
            age three years one social interaction two language as used in social communication or three symbolic or imaginative play while a diagnosis
            of asperger s syndrome observes no clinically significant delay in these areas the dsm makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning
            but the fact that asperger s autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with kanner s autism has produced
            a popular conception that asperger s syndrome is synonymous with higher functioning autism or that it is a lesser disorder than autism
            there is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have
            asperger s autism or that both types are merely geeks with a medical label attached also autism has evolved in the public
            understanding but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in rain man has encouraged relatives of family
            members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having asperger s syndrome rather than autism autism as
            a spectrum disorder another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as autistic spectrum disorders a related
            continuum is sensory integration dysfunction which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our senses autism asperger s
            syndrome and sensory integration dysfunction are all closely related and overlap there are two main manifestations of classical autism regressive autism and
            early infantile autism early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of three and often around
            one eight months although this causes some controversy over when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin some believe that it
            is only a matter of when an environmental toxin triggers the disorder this triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin
            that enters the mother s body and is transfered to the fetus the triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial
            early nervous system development of the child due to a toxin directly entering the child s body increase in diagnoses of autism
            the number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade statistics in graph from the national center for
            health statistics there has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years which is largely reminiscent
            of increases in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder in the twentieth century this has brought rise to a number
            of different theories as to the nature of the sudden increase epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the united states
            is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria reclassifications public awareness and the incentive to receive federally mandated services a
            widely cited study from the m i n d institute in california one seven october two zero zero two claimed that the
            increase in autism is real even after those complicating factors are accounted for see reference in this section below other researchers remain
            unconvinced see references below including dr chris johnson a professor of pediatrics at the university of texas health sciences center at san
            antonio and cochair of the american academy of pediatrics autism expert panel who says there is a chance we re seeing a
            true rise but right now i don t think anybody can answer that question for sure newsweek reference below the answer to
            this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research since a real increase would focus more attention and research funding on
            the search for environmental factors while little or no real increase would focus more attention to genetics on the other hand it
            is conceivable that certain environmental factors vaccination diet societal changes may have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution
            there is little public research on the effects of in vitro fertilization on the number of incidences of autism one of the
            more popular theories is that there is a connection between geekdom and autism this is hinted for instance by a wired magazine
            article in two zero zero one entitled the geek syndrome which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement
            this article many professionals assert is just one example of the media s application of mental disease labels to what is actually
            variant normal behavior they argue that shyness lack of athletic ability or social skills and intellectual interests even when they seem unusual
            to others are not in themselves signs of autism or asperger s syndrome others assert that it is actually the medical profession
            which is applying mental disease labels to children who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or
            even labeled gifted see clinomorphism for further discussion of this issue due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders
            an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high functioning autism or asperger s syndrome in light of symptoms
            they currently experience or experienced during childhood since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic a proportion
            of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow up to their children s diagnoses because autism falls into the pervasive
            developmental disorder category strictly speaking symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a
            differential diagnosis therapies sociology due to the complexity of autism there are many facets of sociology that need to be considered when
            discussing it such as the culture which has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another in addition there are
            several subgroups forming within the autistic community sometimes in strong opposition to one another community and politics much like many other controversies
            in the world the autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups essentially these groups are those who seek a cure
            for autism dubbed pro cure those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it dubbed anti cure
              and the many people caught in the middle of the two in recent history with scientists learning more about autism and possibly
              coming closer to a cure some members of the anti cure movement sent a letter to the united nations demanding to be
              treated as a minority group rather than a group with a mental disability or disease websites such as autistics org present the
              view of the anti cure group there are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups due to the fact that many
              autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person many of these resources are available online in addition sometimes successful autistic
              adults in a local community will help out children with autism much in the way a master would help out an apprentice
              for example two zero zero two was declared autism awareness year in the united kingdom this idea was initiated by ivan and
                charika corea parents of an autistic child charin autism awareness year was led by the british institute of brain injured children disabilities
                trust national autistic society autism london and eight zero zero organizations in the united kingdom it had the personal backing of british
                prime minister tony blair and parliamentarians of all parties in the palace of westminster culture with the recent increases in autism recognition
                and new approaches to educating and socializing autistics an autistic culture has begun to develop similar to deaf culture autistic culture is
                based in a belief that autism is a unique way of being and not a disorder to be cured there are some
                commonalities which are specific to autism in general as a culture not just autistic culture it is a common misperception that people
                with autism do not marry many do get married often they marry another person with autism although this is not always the
                case many times autistics are attracted to other autistics due to shared interests or obsessions but more often than not the attraction
                is due to simple compatibility with personality types the same as is true for non autistics autistics who communicate have explained that
                companionship is as important to autistics as it is to anyone else multigenerational autistic families have also recently become a bit more
                common the interests of autistic people and so called geeks or nerds can often overlap as autistic people can sometimes become preoccupied
                with certain subjects much like the variant normal behavior geeks experience however in practice many autistic people have difficulty with working in
                groups which impairs them even in the most technical of situations autistic adults temple grandin one of the more successful adults with
                autism photograph courtesy joshua nathaniel pritikin and william lawrence jarrold some autistic adults are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs usually
                those with high functioning autism or asperger s syndrome nevertheless communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of the
                autistic s life other autistics are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons
                with disabilities a nurturing environment at home at school and later in job training and at work helps autistic people continue to
                learn and to develop throughout their lives some argue that the internet allows autistic individuals to communicate and form online communities in
                addition to being able to find occupations such as independent consulting which does generally not require much human interaction offline in the
                united states the public schools responsibility for providing services ends when the autistic person is in their two zero s depending on
                each state the family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of
                their adult child as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals autistic savants the
                autistic savant phenomenon is sometimes seen in autistic people the term is used to describe a person who is autistic and has
                extreme talent in a certain area of study although there is a common association between savants and autism an association created by
                the one nine eight eight film rain man most autistic people are not savants mental calculators and fast programming skills are the
                most common form the famous example is daniel tammet the subject of the documentary film the brain man kim peek one of
                the inspirations for dustin hoffman s character in the film rain man is not autistic bright splinters of the mind is a
                book that explores this issue further other pervasive developmental disorders autism and asperger s syndrome are just two of the five pervasive
                developmental disorders pdds the three other pervasive developmental disorders are rett syndrome childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified
                some of these are related to autism while some of them are entirely separate conditions rett syndrome rett syndrome is relatively rare
                affecting almost exclusively females one out of one zero zero zero zero to one five zero zero zero after a period of
                normal development sometime between six and one eight months autism like symptoms begin to appear the little girl s mental and social
                development regresses she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact if she has been talking she
                stops she cannot control her feet she wrings her hands some of these early symptoms may be confused for autism some of
                the problems associated with rett syndrome can be treated physical occupational and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination movement and
                speech scientists sponsored by the national institute of child health and human development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of
                a single gene causes rett syndrome and can physically test for it with a eight zero accuracy rate rett syndrome in the
                past was sometimes classified as an autistic spectrum disorder however most scientists agree that rett syndrome is a separate developmental disorder and
                not part of the autistic spectrum childhood disintegrative disorder childhood disintegrative disorder cdd and sometimes abbreviated as chdd also is a condition
                appearing in three or four year old children who have developed normally until age two over several months the child will deteriorate
                in intellectual social and language functioning from previously normal behaviour this long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate cdd from
                rett syndrome and in fact it must be differentiated from autism in testing the cause for cdd is unknown thus it may
                be a spectrum disorder but current evidence suggests it has something to do with the central nervous system pervasive developmental disorder not
                otherwise specified pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified or pdd nos is referred to as a subthreshold condition because it is a
                classification which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in social interaction communication and or stereotyped behaviour but does not meet
                the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental disorders unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders pdd nos has no
                specific guidelines for diagnosis so the person may have a lot of characteristics of an autistic person or few to none at

                radiation em radiation reflected to the amount incident upon it the fraction usually expressed as a percentage from zero to one zero
                zero is an important concept in climatology and astronomy this ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered unqualified it refers
                to an average across the spectrum of visible light it also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation unqualified normal
                incidence fresh snow albedos are high up to nine zero the ocean surface has a low albedo the average albedo of earth
                is about three zero whereas the albedo of the moon is about seven in astronomy the albedo of satellites and asteroids can
                be used to infer surface composition most notably ice content enceladus a moon of saturn has the highest known albedo of any
                body in the solar system with nine nine of em radiation reflected human activities have changed the albedo via forest clearance and
                farming for example of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale it is
                not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease global warming the classical example of albedo effect is the snow
                temperature feedback if a snow covered area warms and the snow melts the albedo decreases more sunlight is absorbed and the temperature
                tends to increase the converse is true if snow forms a cooling cycle happens the intensity of the albedo effect depends on
                the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation for this reason it can be potentially very large in
                the tropics some examples of albedo effects fairbanks alaska according to the national climatic data center s ghcn two data which is
                composed of three zero year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world the college weather station at fairbanks
                alaska is about three c five f warmer than the airport at fairbanks partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because
                of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of pine trees and therefore less open snowy ground to
                reflect the heat back into space neunke and kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late winter months
                when solar radiation is greater the tropics although the albedo temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of earth because more
                snow falls there it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight when brazilian

                small scale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too people who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a
                greater risk of heatstroke than those who wear white clothes pine forests the albedo of a pine forest at four five n
                in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about nine among the lowest of any naturally
                occurring land environment this is partly due to the color of the pines and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within
                the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level due to light penetration the ocean s albedo is even lower at about
                three five though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation dense swampland averages between nine and one four deciduous
                trees average about one three a grassy field usually comes in at about two zero a barren field will depend on the
                color of the soil and can be as low as five or as high as four zero with one five being about
                the average for farmland a desert or large beach usually averages around two five but varies depending on the color of the
                sand reference edward walker s study in the great plains in the winter around four five n urban areas urban areas in
                particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human built structures which absorb light before the light can reach
                the surface in the northern part of the world cities are relatively dark and walker has shown that their average albedo is
                about seven with only a slight increase during the summer in most tropical countries cities average around one two this is similar
                to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities
                in tropical regions e g there are more very dark trees around another reason is that portions of the tropics are very
                poor and city buildings must be built with different materials warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures
                will remain cooler trees because trees tend to have a low albedo removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool
                the planet cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are one zero to
                five zero higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily studies by the hadley centre have
                investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new
                forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g siberia were neutral or perhaps warming
                snow snow albedos can be as high as nine zero this is for the ideal example however fresh deep snow over a
                featureless landscape over antarctica they average a little more than eight zero if a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to
                melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt the ice albedo feedback this is the basis for predictions of enhanced
                warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of global warming clouds clouds are another source of albedo
                that play into the global warming equation different types of clouds have different albedo values theoretically ranging from a minimum of near
                zero to a maximum in the high seven zero s climate models have shown that if the whole earth were to be
                suddenly covered by white clouds the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about one five zero c two four zero
                f this model though it is far from perfect also predicts that to offset a five c nine f temperature change due
                to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect all we would need to do is increase the earth s overall
                albedo by about one two by adding more white clouds albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds
